Implement a method merge that, given two arrays of sorted integer elements, returns a new sorted array with all the elements of the two input arrays.

Assume that the elements in both input arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order (e.g. [0, 1, 2, 2] and [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]). The returned “merged” array must keep this property (e.g. [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]).

Duplicates are allowed in both the input and the output.

If either one of the arrays are null, return the non-null array as a copy, if both arrays are null, the result should be null as well.

Efficiency requirement: the arrays should be merged in a single pass over the arrays.

IMPORTANT: In an exam setting, your grade for this exercise would be overridden to 1, if you don’t satisfy the requirement mentioned above.
