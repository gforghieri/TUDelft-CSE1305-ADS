Implement a method named reverse that, given an array of integer elements, reverses the order of its elements in-place.

In-place means that you reverse the order of the elements in the array itself, without using an auxiliary array or any other additional data structures.

When the array is null nothing should happen and the algorithm should terminate.

For example: given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected result would be [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

IMPORTANT: In an exam setting, your grade for this exercise would be overridden to 1, if your algorithm isnâ€™t in-place.
