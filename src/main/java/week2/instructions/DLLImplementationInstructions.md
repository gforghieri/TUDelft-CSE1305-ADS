In this exercise, you need to complete the implementation of a class defining a doubly-linked list, DLList, based on the given skeleton code.

This skeleton already contains the implementation of a class Node. Each Node object has an element and a pointer to the next and previous Node. Implementations of methods getNext, getPrevious, setPrevious, getElement and setNext are also provided. You are encouraged to inspect the comments in the definition of this class to understand the structure.

Following the definition of class Node, we have provided you the skeleton of class DLList. You are expected to complete the implementation of this class by completing following methods:

addFirst
removeFirst
addLast
removeLast
size
addAtPosition
removeFromPosition
reverse
You can check the comments in the code to see what each method is expected to implement.

IMPORTANT: You are not allowed to add more fields (class variables) to DLList. In an exam setting, your grade would be overridden to 1, if you do add a field to DLList

IMPORTANT: The reverse method should not mutate the original list. It should return a new list. This is enforced by the specification tests.
