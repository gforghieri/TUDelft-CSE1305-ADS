# Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental notions in computer science and knowledge about standard data structures and algorithm is essential for programmers. This course enables the student to

understand, explain, and implement standard data structures,
understand, explain, and implement standard algorithms,
apply standard data structures and algorithms to solve programming tasks,
analyse and compare implementations with respect to their time and space complexity,
understand, explain, and apply standard programming techniques in the context of standard data structures.
