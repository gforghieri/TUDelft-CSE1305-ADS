Implement a queue with two stacks.

In this question we have provided you with skeleton code of the class Queue.
You are expected to complete the implementation of this class using only two stacks by completing the following methods:

isEmpty()
size()
enqueue(T i)
dequeue()
first()
You can check the comments in the code to see what each method is expected to implement.

Below the skeleton code (after DO NOT MODIFY), you can find the code describing the Stack interface,
which has a full implementation in the library code.

Hint: It is a good idea to work out this assignment with pen and paper by drawing the operations for the queue and two stacks.
