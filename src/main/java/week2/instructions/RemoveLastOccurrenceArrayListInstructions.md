Write a Java method removeLastOccurrence(int x, ArrayList<Integer> list), which removes the last occurrence of an integer x from the arrayList arrList.

Write another Java method removeAll, which should use removeLastOccurrence to remove the entries, until the array list holds no more entries.

The code on the right shows you a code framework in which the implementation of two static methods is still missing. Provide this implementation and check that it is correct by either writing more tests yourself or using the provided tests and specification tests.

IMPORTANT: In an exam setting, if your removeAll method does not use your removeLastOccurrence method to remove all items from the list, your grade would be overridden to 1.
